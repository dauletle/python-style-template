# Python Style Template

A comprehensive Cursor Rule template for Python programming, incorporating best practices from renowned software engineering books and designed to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## Description

This template serves two primary purposes:
1. As a Cursor Rule for the Cursor IDE, providing AI-assisted coding guidance
2. As a reference guide for Python coding style and best practices

## Usage

### As a Cursor Rule
1. Place the `.mdc` files in your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. The rules will automatically activate when working with Python files
3. The AI will use these guidelines to provide consistent, high-quality code suggestions

### As a Style Guide
- Use this as a reference when writing Python code
- Follow the patterns and practices outlined in the rules
- Refer to the examples and explanations for common coding scenarios

## Sources

This template is based on principles and practices from:
- **Code Complete** by Steve McConnell
- **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin
- **The Pragmatic Programmer** by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt

## Structure

The template is organized into several key areas:
- Code organization and structure
- Naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Error handling
- Testing practices
- Performance considerations

## Implementation

To implement these rules in your project:
1. Copy the `.mdc` files to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Customize the rules to match your project's specific needs
3. The AI will automatically apply these guidelines when assisting with Python code

## Benefits

- Consistent code style across your project
- Improved code quality and maintainability
- Reduced time spent on code reviews
- Better collaboration through standardized practices
- AI-assisted coding that follows best practices

## Contributing
